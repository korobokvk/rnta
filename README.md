# KARRI REACT NATIVE EXERCISE

We have put together a simple boilerplate for a React Native exercise. From this simple exercise we can see your compentence and familiarity with using React Native and some core design patterns we use in our everyday coding.

### Please Note

This react project uses the Expo CLI tools - we will be testing via these tools. For Reference: 

* [Setting up a Dev Environment with Expo](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Instructions

Using the boilerplate provided you are asked to extend this app with the following:

1. Create a component which will display a friendly welcome message and image on "TabOne" screen
2. Create a service which allows access to a weather api (your choice) - [Api List](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis)
3. Create a component on "TabTwo" screen which displays todays current weather in a nice a neat layout (use your UI skills to create a custom layout)
4. There are some minor bugs, please find the existing layout issues and fix them
5. Please add a simple splashscreen and logo based on the this icon -> "WiDayCloudyGusts" which can be found on [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)
6. Optional - you can use [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/icon) if you like ;)
7. Optional - there is a blank modal if you want you can maybe add some appropriate information to it. s

Once you have completed the above tasks please commit work in a **NEW BRANCH** on the repo, please use following naming convention - RNTA-(your name)-(date of completion).

We suspect this exercise should take no more than a working day (8 hours) to complete. And look forward to seeing what you come up with. 

### Thank You
